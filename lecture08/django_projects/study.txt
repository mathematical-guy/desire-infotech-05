Steps to create a django project any 
1) Step 1: Run one of following command
 - django-admin startproject <project_name>
 - python -m django-admin startproject <project_name>
 - python -m django startproject <project_name>

This will create a django project with below structure
    project_name
         |
         |
         |-------- manage.py                     [Manages the project actions]
         |
         |
         |-------- project_name
                        |
                        |--------- settings.py   [All settings of the project]
                        |
                        |--------- urls.py       [All urls of the project]


2) Step 2: Run runserver command to check django project is setup properly
   >> python manage.py runserver

Output: 
    Watching for file changes with StatReloader
    Performing system checks...

    System check identified no issues (0 silenced).

    You have 18 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.
    Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

    Django version 3.2, using settings 'project_name.settings'
    Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
    Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ at browser and you will se a rocket animation, 
it means django project setup is done.

3) Create a view (function) in urls.py and add it's url in urlpatterns
inside urls.py

from django.http import HttpResponse

def home_page(request):
    return HttpResponse("<h1> This is the Home Page </h1>)


urlpatterns = [
    path('admin'/, admin.site.urls),

    path('home/', home_page),      <-------- your added url
]

visit at http://127.0.0.1:8000/home/ you will see your Output of view


4) Create a folder anywhere in the project 
(prefer creating inside the outer project directory, where manage.py is already there)
Add file location in DIRS of TEMPLATES list inside settings.py

TEMPLATES = [
    {
        ...
        'DIRS': [r"YOUR_FOLDER_PATH"]
        ...
    }
]


Create a template(html) file in YOUR_FOLDER_PATH. For e.g myfile.html

<html>
    <body>
        <h1>This is My File page<h1>
        <p>Welcome to Desire Infotech</p>
    </body>
</html>


Create a view inside urls which will return render this html file as


from django.shortcuts import render

def myfile_view(request):
    return render(request, 'myfile.html')


urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('desire/', myfile_view),           <----------- New view with URL is added
    ...
]
